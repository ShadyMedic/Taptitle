# Taptitle (name likely to be changed)

So let's say that you are learning a foreign language.

You already know the basics and can understand simple conversations. You hear everywhere, that the best way to expand your vocabullary is to watch movies in the foreign language.

So you go to a streaming service, find a movie or a show of your interest and start watching with subtitles in your language. You're having fun.

But after a few episodes you realise, that you focus mostly on reading the subtitles and mostly ignore the audio.

So you try a different approach. You change the language of the subtitles into the foreign language you're trying to learn.

Suddently you aren't having as much fun anymore, as you realise that you aren't proficient enough in the language and can understand only a small portion of the sentences.

You don't want to go back to books and flashcards, but you don't see a different option.

## But then your remember about Taptile

You load the taptile webpage. You paste a link to a video or choose one from your local file system. Then you download the subtitles in your desired language and link them as well.

You play the video. Everything seems to be the same as when you tried this on a streaming service. A weird word appears on the screen and you have no idea what it means. "Here we go again" you think, as you reach for a mouse to pause the video and open Google Translate..

But your hand slipped and you clicked the weird word instead.

The video paused and a text box appeared under the word:
> *BlumenhÃ¤ndler* means *Florist*.  
The word has been saved into your personal dictionary  
[Undo]

After a second, the video unpauses and you continue watching.

This goes on and on. You keep clicking on random words here and there and after half and hour, you finish the episode.

> Congrats on finishing the video. You found 73 new words.  
They have been added to your [personal dictionary](#).  
You can export your dictionary to [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) at any time [here](#).

And you keep watching movies in foregin language with foreign subtitles and build your vocabullary one episode at a time.
